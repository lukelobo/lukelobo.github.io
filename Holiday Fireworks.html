                <h2>Holiday</h2>
                <p>To celebrate the holidays that happen throughout the year Disneyland has a firework for each holiday season. Specifically they have 4th of July fireworks, Disneyland Halloween Screams, Believe in Holiday Magic, and New Year's Eve.
                <h3>4th of July</h3>
                This firework show obviously is there for the days near and on the 4th of July. Up until my most recent family visits we have gone around the 4th of July now. Not that long ago <strong>they started to utilize main street projections</strong> thanks in part to the 60th anniversary fireworks.

                <h3>Halloween Screams</h3>
                This firework show occurs on nights in September leading up to Halloween night itself. Luckily everyone can be able to see this night time show <strong>unlike</strong> World of Color Villainous which is only for visitors who bought Oogie Boogie Bash tickets.

                <h3>Believe in Holiday Magic</h3>
                This firework show starts to light up the sky during the Christmas season which usually begins around November.

                <h3>New Year's Eve</h3>
                This firework is a one day showing every year and makes sense for Disneyland to have special fireworks for the holiday that every major city around the world celebrates with a fireworks show.
