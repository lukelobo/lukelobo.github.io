                <h2>Fantasmic</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several forms of entertainment at Disneyland but <strong>one of my all time favorites</strong> is Fantasmic. It has been my favorite show since I was little maybe it might
                    have been due to the <strong>climactic battle between Sorcerer Mickey and Maleficent</strong> or <strong>the sword fights between Peter Pan and Captain Hook or more recently
                    Captain Jack Sparrow</strong>. That being said here are some tips for either getting a good spot or making sure you get a great seating area. For getting a good spot you should try your best to find
                    an area that has a great view of the Rivers of America and Tom Sawyer Island. In the past my family and I would always use the bridge above the line to Pirates of the Carribean, but during our most recent visit we
                    were able to find a good spot near the golden horseshoe. I mentioned making sure you get a great seating area but this is for if Disney decideds to bring back the show fastpass or maybe utilize the virtual queue system for it.
                    If they bring back the fastpass idea then as soon as you enter the park you should head over to Big Thunder Mountain and there should be a kiosk where it will have the tickets with your seating/viewing area. 
                    Same idea for the virtual queue however for that you would need to have the Disneyland app in order to place your party into the queue. It is best to be prepared since Disney plans to bring the show back next year following an accident
                    that resulted in the dragon animatronic going up in flames.*<h2>*:</h2>Below is a picture of the dragon before the incident occured earlier this year.
