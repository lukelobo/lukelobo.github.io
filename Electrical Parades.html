        <h2>Electrical Parades</h2>
        <p>
          There have been a total of 2 different electrical parades that have been at Disneyland on way more often than the other. Those 2 being none other than the Main Street Electrical Parade, and the Paint the Night Parade. 
          <h3><strong>Tips</strong></h3>
          The only tip I can give for these parades is the same for daytime parades being to find a spot to sit as early as you can or else it may fill up and you would have to stand.
          <h3>Trivia/History</h3>
          Out of the two the Main Street Electrical Parade has been at both Disneyland and California Adventure longer than Paint the Night as you can see in the list below. 
          <h3>Main Street Electrical Parade</h3>
          <li>1972-1996: Disneyland</li>
          <li>2001-2010: DCA</li>
          <li>2017-2019, 2022: Disneyland</li>
          <h3>Paint the Night Parade</h3>
          <li>2015-2017: Disneyland</li>
          <li>2018: DCA</li>
          <br>
          <strong>Fun Fact!</strong> Even though both use lights for the floats they also ended up getting new floats at certain returns. For instance before the main street electrical parade left DCA in 2010 they added a new float to promote the new Tinker Bell Movie
          also on its return in 2022 they added in a new float and some new lights to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the parade itself. Paint the Night also got a new float to promote both an upcoming movie and a seasonal event during its 2018 return those promotions were for the Pixar Fest event and The Incredibles 2 movie.
