        <h2>Electrical Parades</h2>
        <p>
          There have been a total of 2 different electrical parades that have been at Disneyland on way more often than the other. Those 2 being none other than the Main Street Electrical Parade, and the Paint the Night Parade.
          
          <h3><strong>Tips</strong></h3>
          The only tip I can give for these parades is the same for daytime parades being to find a spot to sit as early as you can or else it may fill up and you would have to stand.
          
          <h3>Trivia/History</h3>
          Out of the two the Main Street Electrical Parade has been at both Disneyland and California Adventure longer than Paint the Night as you can see in the list below.
          
          <h3>Main Street Electrical Parade</h3>

          When it came back in 2022, Disney implemented brand new lights and a new finale floate to celebrate the parade's 50th anniversary as you can see above. 
          
          <h3>Paint the Night Fun Fact</h3>
          Paint the Night also got a new float to promote both an upcoming movie and a seasonal event during its 2018 return those promotions were for the Pixar Fest event and The Incredibles 2 movie.
