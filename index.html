        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Luis Campos, and I have been going to Disneyland ever since I was 4 years old with my family for father's day*. <strong>Thanks to the numerous trips to the parks I know everything like the back of my hand.</strong>
          (A picture of the me and my family from one of my trips in the past can be seen below.) 
          My reason for wanting to create this website was to help out anyone that plans to go on their first ever trip to <strong>The Happiest Place On Earth</strong> so that it could be magical for everyone and live up to expectations. 
          This <a href="https://mickeyblog.com/2023/08/23/top-ten-reasons-to-visit-disneyland-in-2024/#:~:text=Disney%20has%20re%2Dthemed%20the,futuristic%20realm%2C%20San%20Fransokyo%20Square.&text=You'll%20want%20to%20visit,at%20a%20Japanese%20beer%20garden." title = "Reasons to go to disneyland next year">link</a> here will show a few reasons to go next year. 
          I hope that the tips and tricks I mention can be helpful for everyone.
