                <h2>Disneyland Attractions</h2>
                <p>There are several rides at Disneyland that I consider to be my favorites and I hope these tips/trivias can help you to enjoy these rides as well.</p>
                <h2>Star Tours</h2>
                <img src="https://www.parksavers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/5D0C8362-D2EB-4EA1-954A-87087702DF22-scaled.jpeg" width="500">
                <p>First attraction I wanted to talk about is Star Tours. When it first opened there was only one film that took your vehicle to the planet Endor and the famous Death Star trench run. However, now there are several different beginnings, middles, and endings and next year they plan to add in even more options to make your adventure with star tours more interesting. Here are some tips that can possibly
                help you to enjoy the ride more.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>when you enter the 2nd room look to the right and you'll see the original pilot robot before the update and C3PO took his spot.</li>
                    <li>while in the same room pay close attention to the luggage checking droid and he might scan a piece of luggauge with certain easter eggs like a helmet or even a certain space ranger.</li>
                    <li>there will also be a window lit up before you turn around pay close attention to the silloetts and you may find your favorite character from the Star Wars universe.</li>
                    <li>finally if you look at the screen behind the robot talking to you you are actually looking at yourself.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Forbidden Eye</h2>
                <img src="https://www.parksavers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Indiana-Jones-Adventure-Ride.jpg" width="500">
                <p>The second attraction I wanted to talk about is Indiana Jones and this attraction holds some special memories to me. Here are some tips to make the wait for the ride more enjoyable.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>when you enter the room with a bamboo pole if you pull on it then there will be some sounds as if things were happening to the temple you are walking in.</li>
                    <li>if you see the treasure room and pull on the rope near the tablet even if it says don't pull on the rope <strong>DO IT!</strong></li>
                    <li>Essentially if you see a sign that says to not do something? Do it.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Space Mountain/Hyperspace Mountain</h2>
                <img src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2023/05/hyperspace-mountain-disneyland-3.jpg" width="500">
                <p>The third attraction I wanted to talk about is Space Mountain and its Hyperspace variant. Here are some tips and trivia to enjoy this exhilerating ride through the stars.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Usually around the fan holiday May the 4th Disneyland switches from Space to Hyperspace which is essentially the same ride but with a Star Wars theme to it. By this I mean that you'll see Star Wars characters going over safety spiels and on the ride you'll hear Star Wars music.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>> As part of Disneyland's 50th anniversary they got composer Micheal Giacchino to create a new soundtrack for Space Mountain and it has remained the same ever since. If you have no clue who I am talking about you may have already heard his works in some movies like The Increbiles, the MCU Spider Man triology, Up, and Lightyear to name a few</li>
                    <li>Also in the past around Halloween Space Mountain would have a Halloween themed overlay called Ghost Galaxy.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>It's a Small World</h2>
                <img src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2021/12/Disneyland-its-a-small-world-1-7441734-scaled-6425790.webp" width="500">
                <p>The next attraction I wanted to talk about is the infamous It's a Small World ride. I say infamous because some people find it annoying that they have the same song on repeat in different languages but I think with these tips and trivial you might realize it is not as annoying as some people think it is.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>For quite some time they have placed dolls based off of popular disney characters in location you would expect to see them and it is fun to try and play I spy with your group of where the characters are</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> At every 15 minutes the building facade will show the time and occasionally they show the same dolls you see on ride go out of the double doors and head back inside.</li>
                    <li>This ride also has a Christmas themed ride overlay and they tend to sing christmas songs in the different languages along with the titular it's a small world song.</li>
                    <li>If you still don't like it then you can at least get a funny shirt from the gift shop that says "I survived It's a Small World"</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Also this ride as well as the other little kid attractions like Snow White, Pinnochio, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Winnie the Pooh are great to go on if they have a short wait time on a hot day because they all have AC</p>
                <h2>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</h2>
                <img src="https://allears.net/dlr/tp/dl/dl18attr_32.jpg" width="500">
                <p>Here are some tips and trivia to enjoy <strong>the wildest ride in the wilderness!</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>At one point in the attraction if you focus on a goat that is biting down on a stick of dynamite you may feel like the turn is bigger than it really is.</li>
                    <li><strong>This next tip is really helpful trust me.</strong> If you have your backpack or napsack carrying your things with you when you go on if they don't fit in the ride vehicle's pouch then place your legs through the arm staps of your bag that way they won't go flying out and onto the track or into part of the ride facade.</li>
                    <li>Also some Disneyland parkgoers created a challenge for people to do and that is to "climb" the mountains of Disneyland (i.e. ride on Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, and the Matterhorn). It used to include Splash Mountain but recently Disney closed it and plan to change the theme to Princess and the Frog.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Pirates of the Caribbean</h2>
                <img src="https://www.disneyfoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/disneyland-new-orleans-square-pirates-of-the-caribbean.jpg" width="500">
                <p>Here are some tips and some trivia to enjoy your swashbuckling adventure. Savy?</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you look closely at the rock formation in the treasure room you might just find a hidden Mickey</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> At 3 different parts you can find Captain Jack Sparrow, as well as Captain Barbossa quick heads up you might get wet due to a stray cannonball landing near the ride vehicle.</li>
                    <li>Also in the section that you see the pirate holding the treasure chest that used to have a fog and projection combo to show either Davy Jones, or Blackbeard to promote the Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End, and On Stranger Tides movies.</li>
                </ol>
