    <h1>Disneyland 101 with Luis</h1>
    <h2>Tips, Tricks, and trivia about my favorite things from <strong>The Happiest Place on Earth</strong></h2>
    <header><h3>Fantasmic</h3></header>
    <p>So I have gone to Disneyland several times in the past with my family, have had a lot of <strong>fond</strong> memories, and watched several shows. With my favorite one being the night time show Fantasmic,
      The main reason as to why is that it includes several different Disney movies while focusing on Mickey Mouse's imagination. <strong>It utilimately ends with a battle between Mickey in his Sorcerer's Aprrentice outfit fighting Maleficent in her dragon form.</strong>
      A picture of the dragon from one of my trips in the past animatronic can be seen below. 
      However, in my most recent trip to Disneyland they did not have the night time show on account of what happened earlier this year. That being the dragon caught fire and forced Disney to end showings of it but it will return next year. 
      This <a href="https://ktla.com/news/theme-parks/disneyland/disneylands-fantasmic-on-hiatus-until-spring-2024-will-return-without-dragon/" title = "Farewell old friend">link</a> here will take you to a news article about what Disney plans to do after that incident. 
      Even though I am excited for the return of Fantasmic next year, I will never forget the epic final battle between the Sorcerer's Apprentice and the Mistress of All Evil in her dragonic form.
