                <h2>Pixar Play Parade</h2>
                <p>This parade has been quite a popular parade over in California Adventure because it initially ran from 2008-2011 and ran again from 2012-2017. In fact during the Pixar Fest event it even went down Main Street USA over in Disneyland.
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                If they ever decide to bring it back some tips that I have for this parade include the same tip of finding your spot early but my restaurant idea won't be that helpful since there are not that many restaurants with outdoor seatings with a view of the parade. That being said another thing to keep in mind with this parade is that the floats spray out water.

                <p><h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                In 2013 they updated the first float unit to include some new characters from the new Monster's University movie. Also when it came back for Pixar Fest Disney included a unit for the Lamp and the Luxo Ball as well as floats for Inside Out and Up.</p>
