                <h2>DCA(Disney California Adventure) Attractions</h2>
                <p>There are some rides at Disney California Adventure that I consider to be my favorites and I hope these tips/trivias can help you to enjoy these rides as well.</p>
                <h2>Radiator Springs Racers</h2>
                <img src="https://media.wdwnt.com/2021/12/lightning-lane-4-8145882-scaled.jpg" width="500">
                <p>The first attraction I want to talk about is my favorite attraction in Cars Land being Radiator Springs Racers. Here are some tips, and trivia to enjoy this race around Radiator Springs.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Out of all 3 opening day attractions when Cars Land opened this attraction had a lot of problems throughout the day. I speak from experience since my family and I were able to go to Cars Land on opening day.</li>
                    <li>I think it would be best to try to ride this attraction at night since it is really pretty when the ride starts since the lights to the mountain range would be on when you hear the grand music of seeing the waterfall.</li>
                    <li>This attraction actually uses a similar vehicle track when compared to the attraction Test Track over at EPCOT in Florida</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>California Screamin'/The Incredicoaster</h2>
                <img src="https://yesterland.com/images-caladventure4/screamin_sign2002tm.jpg" width="500">
                <img src="https://attractionsmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Incredicoaster-entrance.jpeg" width="500">
                <p>The next attraction I want to talk about is one of my all time favorite attractions being California Screamin'/The Incredicoaster. Here are some tips and trivia to enjoy this <strong>INCREDIBLE</strong> ride</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>This attraction was Disneyland's first ever rollercoaster with an inversion(i.e. loop de loop, corkscrew, barrel roll, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Due to the retheme of Paradise Pier to Pixar Pier they changed California Screamin' into The Incredicoaster.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> When you see Mr. Incredible trying to give a cookie to Jack Jack you might just get the scent of a fresh chocolate chip cookie.</li>
                    <li>One major thing to keep in mind since they have World of Color this attraction usually closes so that they can use the lights on the ride for the show.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror/Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout</h2>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bosH9sPfjwo/maxresdefault.jpg" width="500">
                <img src="https://dvcshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Mission-BREAKOUT-Sign-Wide-Angle-scaled-e1622598152975.jpg" width="500">
                <p>The next attraction I plan to talk about is another one my favorites being The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, or since 2017 Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One fond memory that I have of going on this attraction back when it was Tower of Terror was when it got to the part of the ride where it says wave goodbye to the real world me and my sister both did just that and we would do that on every ride through.</li>
                    <li>Just like California Screamin' to The Incredicoaster, Disney changed Tower of Terror to Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout has a similar ride feel to Star Tours because depending on what classic song plays on the ride you might see a different scenario with breaking the Guardians out of the Fortress.</li>
                    <li>Also just like Space Mountain, Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission Breakout also has a Halloween themed overlay called Guardians of the Galaxy: Monsters After Dark where the creatures broke out and you need to help Rocket find and save Groot.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Soarin' Over California/Soarin' Around the World</h2>
                <img src="https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2023/03/030422CT2MB-0516.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675" width="500">
                <img src="https://cdn.getawaytoday.com/api/content/image/H3DK52UZ91JBGDGC/soarin-around-the-world-a-scene-by-scene-guide-entrance.jpg" width="500">
                <p>Next up is another personal favorite of mine being both versions of Soarin.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One tip I have for either version of Soarin' is try to be in the front row that way you can fully feel immersed in the thrill of feeling like you are flying over California, or flying over the world.</li>
                    <li>This ride originally was an opening day attraction for the California Adventure park and occasionally comes back during the Food and Wine Festival.</li>
                    <li>In both versions of Soarin' they have a Hidden Mickey somewhere in the ride. Specifically, in Soarin' Over California when you get to the golf course part the Mickey is actually on the golf ball. For Soarin' Around the World, the Mickey can be found with the placement of the balloons</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Monster's Inc. Mike and Sulley to the Rescue</h2>
                <img src="https://wdwnt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Image-from-iOS-277-1120256-1200x900.jpg" width="500">
                <p>The next attraction is Monster's Inc. Mike and Sulley to the Rescue. Here are some tips to enjoy this ride.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One tip to enjoy this ride is to pay attention to the little videos in the waiting area since there are a few funny ones.</li>
                    <li>Another tip for this ride as well as The Little Mermaid Ariel's Undersea Adventure, Mickey's Philharmagic, and Grizzly River Run: You can go on any of these rides if it ends up being on a really hot day in the park.</li>
                    <li>The Roz animatronic near the end might just double check if you remebered to turn in your paperwork, or ask you to get her a churro.</li>
