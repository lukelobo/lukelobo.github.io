                <p>For every firework show at Disneyland the only tip I have is to stay in the same area where your group was if you chose to watch a night time show or parade. But with that being said if you want you can click on any of the links below to get some trivia or history surrounding certain fireworks they have to offer or have offered in the past.</p>
