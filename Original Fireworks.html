                <h2>Original</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though Disneyland has multiple fireworks to celebrate holidays and special anniversaries they have also created completely original fireworks. These 2 fireworks include Mickey's Mix Magic and the Together Forever fireworks.
                    <h2>Mickey's Mix Magic</h2>
                    This fireworks show included remixes of memorable Disney movie songs remixes that you might possible hear at a club. Even though this fireworks show premiered in 2019 as a way to celebrate Mickey Mouses's 90th anniversary Disney has brought it back a couple of times like the 60th fireworks. A prime example of this can be seen when they brought Mickey's Mix Magic back as they reopened after the COVID shutdown.
                    <h2>Together Forever</h2>
                    This fireworks show was actually the very first Pixar focused fireworks show aired at Disneyland since they had the special Pixar Fest at that time and has not brought it back.

                <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Mickey's Mix Magic was the first fireworks show at Disneyland to incorporate a movie song that was sung fully in spanish into a night time show. Even though both Together Forever and Mix Magic had a section themed to the movie Coco, Together Forever features a song that was sung both in english and spanish being The World Es Mi Familia while Mickey's Mix Magic used the spanish version of Un Poco Loco</p>
