                <h2>World of Color</h2>
                <p>
                    One thing to keep in mind is that this night time show is only viewable in Disney California Adventure (D.C.A.). This night time show premiered in the summer of 2010 and it holds a lot of personal meaning to me since my dad passed away before he could see it or the other variations.
                    I say variations because much like the fireworks Disney created some variations of the show that occur at different times of the year to represent either a holiday or an anniversary.

                    <h3>Tips</h3>
                    The only tip I have for getting a good seating area is to constantly check and double check your Disneyland app on the Virtual Queue section since they originally had fastpasses but up until recently they started using Virtual Queues.

                    <h3>Trivia/History</h3>
                    <h3>World of Color Celebrate!</h3>
                    This variation went on for a limited time back in 2015 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Disneyland Resort. It featured Neil Patrick Harris who at the time World of Color came out also helped with the attraction California Screamin', characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and Star Wars The Force Awakens.
                    
                    <h3>World of Color Villainous</h3>
                    This variation so far has only performed back in 2019 on select nights in September and October to coincide with a limited ticketed event they started being the Oogie Boogie Bash. However ever since they reopened after the pandemic they have not brought this version back. Also I was not able to see this one.
                    
                    <h3>World of Color Season of Light</h3>
                    This variation usually performs around Christmas time with different christmas songs with a Disney twist. I have not seen this one before.
                    
                    <h3>Grad Nite GOODNITE</h3>
                    This variation only are for graduating seniors that attend grad night events that Disney tends to hold near the end of May and early June. I never saw that but I think one of my family trips was right around that time.
                    
                    <h3>World of Color: Celebrate the Spirit of America</h3>
                    This variation as implied by the name only occurs on the 4th of July. If you want my honest opinion I prefer the special 4th of July fireworks they have over in Disneyland. I say this because my family only recently started to go for the 4th and we all agreed that Disneyland has better fireworks since they incorporate Main Street USA projections.
                    
                    <h3>World of Color One</h3>
                    This variation is the most recent and current version which is to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Walt Disney Company. (Yes you heard that right 100 years of Disney). Even though they still have it going on right now it will soon be replaced for the Season of Light. After that I am honestly leaning towards the idea that the original version will return and not World of Color One since the 100th anniversary is this year not next year.
