                <h2>Mickey's Soundsational Parade</h2>
                <p>This parade has been quite a popular parade that has gone down Disneyland's parade route because it premiered back in May of 2011 and went away for 2017 only to return in 2019 for Mickey and Minnie's 90th anniversary.
                <h3>Tips</h3>
                One thing to note is that most parades tend to have either 1 or 2 showings and if there is 2 then the first is starting at It's a Small World while the second will begin at Main Street. One thing my family and I did in the past is that you could try to have something to eat over at the refreshment corner restaurant and you have a table for the parade. Other than that find a place to sit before the parade begins just like what I mentioned for the electrical parades find a spot early on that way you don't have to stand up to see it.

                <p><h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                When it came back in 2019 they added in new draggable floats after Mickey's float as a way to celebrate his 90th anniversary as you can see above.</p>
