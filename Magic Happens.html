                <h2>Magic Happens</h2>
                <p>This parade is the most recent and the current parade over at Disneyland. It is really new because it premiered on a few weeks before Disneyland had to shut down because of the pandemic back in 2020, and it just came back earlier this year as a way to kick off the 100th anniversary celebration at Disneyland.
                <h3>Tips/Trivia</h3>
                For this parade the tips are the same as Mickey's Soundsational Parade. However it was the first parade to include floats for Moana, Coco, and Frozen 2. It also gave some love to a classic Disney Movie that movie being the Sword in the Stone since it has its own part in the finale of the parade. Not only that but it featured a variation of Mickey's classic Sorcerer's Apprentice outfit which from knowledge hasn't happened before here in the US*.

                <p><h3>Explanation</h3>
                *: I said here in the US because I saw a video comparing the ending of the fantasmics in California, Florida, and Japan. The finale in both US feature the traditional red robe and blue sorcerer hat colors while over in Tokyo it had a more rainbow like color. Funny enough even though mickey is in his sorcerer outfit for the paint the night parade they still kept it with the same colors
