                <p>
                    For every firework show at Disneyland I only have a few tips like staying in the same area where your group was if you chose to watch a night time show or parade. Another tip for fireworks is that it is better to see them either in Main Street USA, or over near the Rivers of America to see projections on the buildings/water screens. 
                    One final tip that I have is if you and your group are staying  in a hotel that is close to Disneyland then you can see the fireworks from your hotel, but it is much better to watch it from inside the park.
                    But with that being said if you want you can click on any of the links below to get some trivia or history surrounding certain fireworks they have to offer or have offered in the past.
